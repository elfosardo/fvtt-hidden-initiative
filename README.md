# Foundry VTT Hidden Initiative

"Hidden Initiative" is a [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/) module that makes some changes to how initiative is rolled.

The goal of this module is to allow:

-   Defaulting to "GM" visibility for initiative rolls
-   Hiding the visibility of raw initiative values from your players

Vanilla Foundry VTT will roll initiative for monsters (and players) in public, and then show the initiative scores in the Combat Tracker.

If you prefer more suspenseful combat, Hidden Initiative allows you to:

1. Show a placeholder "?" when you first roll monster initiative
2. Leave the final initiative order ambiguous until a full round has completed

You, the DM, will see the exact initiative at all times. Your players will be uncertain of who has the next turn until you press that "Next turn" button, at which point the next monster (or player) will slot into position on their screens.

Once a full round of combat has finished, the initiative order is considered public knowledge and won't re-sort itself any longer.
